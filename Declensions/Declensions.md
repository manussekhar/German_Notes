Declensions
- helps to move around nouns in a sentence so that it makes sense.
- comes in front of nouns to identify which nominative, dative and accusative nouns.
- changes pronouns(they, them) and adjectives(big, tall) based on certain rules.

STEPS
1. Determine the noun’s gender & case
2. Find the corresponding section of the All-In-One Declensions Chart
3. Identify which declension pattern fits the determiner and/or
adjective(s) preceding the noun.
4. Apply the declensions listed in the All-In-One Declensions Chart as per
the dictates of the declension pattern.

NOTES
● Remember: noun gender is STATIC -- it doesn’t change! It will always be either
masculine, feminine, neuter, or plural (which, grammatically-speaking, is like a 4th
gender).
● However, the CASE of the noun ​does​ change, mostly due either to the r​ ole​ the noun is
playing (subject, direct object, indirect object) or to a prepositional phrase (most often
in either the accusative or dative case).
● Of the declension patterns, #1 (the standard, default pattern) and #3 (adjectives only)
can occur at ANY of the All-In-One Declension Chart’s 16 intersections.
● Pattern #2 is used at strictly 3 intersections (see the ‘notes’ on the chart!) and pattern
#4 is used only with the plurals column of the chart.
● NOTICE the 2 basic principles of the declension patterns graphic: 1) there is a
preference for the ​strong​ declension and 2) generally, determiners and adjectives take
separate​ declensions.
● These 2 principles ^^ are followed exactly by pattern #1 and then only in part by the
three remaining, ‘exception-to-the-rule’ patterns.
